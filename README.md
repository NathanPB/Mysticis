# Mysticis Mod
Mysticis is a Minecraft mod that has a mystical/magic theme. The project still in devlopment, but the plan is to create a solid and creative mod to the community of this awesome game.

## Installation
Mysticis runs over the FabricMC API. Being the Fabric Loader required to use the mod. You can find instructions about Fabric installation [here](https://fabricmc.net/use/).

Due Mysticis being a very starter project we don't have any release yet. To this phase of the project it's required to compile the source code by yourself in order to have a working .jar file.

In the future it should be released in modding platforms like [curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods).

## Maintaining
Me, [NathanPB](https://github.com/NathanPB), am the only active maintainer of the mod. Even though I already got some experience in programming, I'm completely new to Minecraft direct modding, and Mysticis is being a learning experience for me. I'm also totally new in texture or model design, so you should'n expect very good looking things. I may provide a full texture remake if I somehow manage to make this mod grow up.

If you are interested in helping the project any kind of contribution is valid. It counts code, art, documentation, shares, stars, bug reports, tutorials or even just playing. **Absolutely any kind of contribution is welcome.**

## Discord
I'm setting up a Discord guild used to discuss about Mysticis. This guild was previously used by me and my friends in the very initial discussion of the mod. Thank they all for motivating me to continue the project.
